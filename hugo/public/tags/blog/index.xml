      <description>EdJex.net blog For some reason I have decided to make my thoughts public. This is probably not a good idea. Nevertheless I have done it anyway. At the very least this should be a good way to document my projects.

&lt;p&gt;For some reason I have decided to make my thoughts public. This is probably not a good idea. Nevertheless I have done it anyway.
At the very least this should be a good way to document my projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;tech-stack-&#34;&gt;Tech Stack üñ•Ô∏è&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://edjex.net&#34;&gt;edjex.net&lt;/a&gt; website is built using &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.solidjs.com/&#34;&gt;Solid.js&lt;/a&gt;. The blog section is separate and this is built using &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/&#34;&gt;hugo&lt;/a&gt; which is a static site generator. Content is written in Markdown and then hugo renders it as HTML. The theme I am using is &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal&#34;&gt;terminal theme by panr&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;blog-&#34;&gt;Blog üì∞&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea is that this blog should be about the projects I am working on. Partly to keep track of my past projects and partly to give some context to the content on my CV.&lt;/p&gt;
