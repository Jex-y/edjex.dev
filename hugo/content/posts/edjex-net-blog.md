# edjex.net blog

Hi, the intent of this blog is to document some of my projects and share tips that I have learned. This post is mainly just a test post.

## Tech Stack :desktop_computer:

The [edjex.net](https://edjex.net) website is built using [Solid.js](https://www.solidjs.com/). The blog section is separate and this is built using [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) which is a static site generator. Content is written in Markdown and then hugo renders it as HTML. The theme I am using is [terminal theme by panr](https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal).
