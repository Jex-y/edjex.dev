# edjex.net blog

For some reason I have decided to make my thoughts public. This is probably not a good idea. Nevertheless I have done it anyway.
At the very least this should be a good way to document my projects.

## Tech Stack :desktop_computer:

The [edjex.net](https://edjex.net) website is built using [Solid.js](https://www.solidjs.com/). The blog section is separate and this is built using [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) which is a static site generator. Content is written in Markdown and then hugo renders it as HTML. The theme I am using is [terminal theme by panr](https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal).

## Blog :newspaper:

The idea is that this blog should be about the projects I am working on. Partly to keep track of my past projects and partly to give some context to the content on my CV.
